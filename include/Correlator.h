/*!
  \brief correlate decays with previous implants
  
  The class controls the correlations of decays with previous implants.  There
  are arrays of size MAX_STRIP %x MAX_STRIP that store implants and decays.
  When an event has been identified as either an implant or decay, its
  information is placed in the appropriate array based on its pixel location.
  If a decay was identified, it is correlated with a previous implant.  The
  correlator checks to make sure that the time between implants is
  sufficiently long and that the correlation time has not been exceeded
  before correlating an implant with a decay.
